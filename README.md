Apart from ui.R and server.R which are used for implementing the webapp, the repsitory also contains the modelDev.R which was used to generate a random forest model which was later deployed with the shiny app.

##How to use the App

* Enter the Flower Details (Sepal Width, Petal Length, etc.) on the left side bar.
* Click the submit button.
* Results will be displayed in the right side pane.
* Notice that it might take some time to load the random forest library.
